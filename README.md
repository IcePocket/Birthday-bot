# BirthdayBot

**The bot is offline right now.  
If you are willing to use the code for announcing birthdays in your server until the bot is online again,
you need to ask me first. You can do this through Discord: Arik#8773**

This is a discord bot that announces birthdays.  
It works with time zones, allows you to see upcoming and recent birthdays in a server,  
and soon, you will be able to send birthday wishes to your friends with it.
